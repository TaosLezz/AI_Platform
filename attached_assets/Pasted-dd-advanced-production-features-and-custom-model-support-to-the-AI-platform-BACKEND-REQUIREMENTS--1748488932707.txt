   - Platform analytics and reporting
   - System configuration management
   - Model deployment controls

5. Advanced API Endpoints:
   - POST /api/v1/models/upload (custom model upload)
   - GET /api/v1/models/list (available models)
   - POST /api/v1/models/compare (A/B testing)
   - POST /api/v1/batch/process (batch job creation)
   - GET /api/v1/batch/{job_id}/status (job status)
   - GET /api/v1/admin/users (admin user management)
   - GET /api/v1/admin/analytics (platform analytics)
   - POST /api/v1/admin/models/deploy (model deployment)

6. Docker Configuration:
