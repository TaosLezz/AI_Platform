dd MLOps tracking and monitoring to the authenticated AI platform:

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install dependencies: mlflow, redis, celery, psutil

2. MLflow Integration:
   - MLflow tracking server setup (SQLite backend)
   - Log all AI requests with user context
   - Track metrics: latency, memory usage, success rate
   - Store input/output artifacts
   - Link runs to user accounts

3. Performance Monitoring:
   - Real-time performance tracking decorator
   - Memory and CPU usage monitoring
   - Request/response time measurement
   - Error rate tracking
   - System health metrics

4. Caching System:
   - Redis integration for result caching
   - Cache key generation based on service + input
   - TTL management
   - Cache hit/miss statistics

5. New API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/experiments (user's MLflow experiments)
   - GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id} (specific run details)
   - GET /api/v1/metrics/dashboard (aggregated metrics)
   - GET /api/v1/performance/stats (system performance)
   - GET /api/v1/cache/stats (cache statistics)

6. Enhanced AI Service Endpoints:
   - Add MLflow logging to all existing AI services
   - Performance monitoring integration
   - Cache checking before processing
   - User usage increment after successful requests

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. MLflow Dashboard:
   - Experiments list with filtering
   - Run details with metrics visualization
   - Performance charts (line/bar charts using Recharts)
   - Real-time metrics updates

2. Analytics Page:
   - User's personal usage analytics
   - Performance trends over time
   - Service usage breakdown
   - Success/failure rates

3. Enhanced AI Service Pages:
   - Processing time display
   - Cache hit indicators
   - Request history with MLflow links
   - Performance feedback

4. System Status Page:
   - Real-time system health
   - Cache status
   - Service availability
   - Performance metrics

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- All AI requests must log to MLflow with user ID
- Performance metrics tracked per user role
- Cache usage statistics in user dashboard
- MLflow runs accessible only to request owner (+ admins)

Update existing AI service functions to include monitoring, caching, and MLflow integration while maintaining current functionality.
